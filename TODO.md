Based on your decision to close the PR with the A2A python-based project and focus on React/TypeScript projects, it makes sense to adjust the priorities in your TODO list. Let me revise the list to better align with a React/TypeScript-focused approach:

# Revised TODO List for AI Agent Fingerprinting System (React/TypeScript Focus)

## Completed Items ✅
1. **Fix RevokeFingerprint Component to Use Feature Detection**
   - ✅ Improved compatibility with different contract versions
   - ✅ Implemented proper feature detection instead of hardcoded contract addresses
   - ✅ Added graceful degradation for contracts without revocation support

2. **Implement Secure Key Management Following OWASP Guidelines**
   - ✅ Created KeyProvider interface with multiple implementations
   - ✅ Implemented EnvKeyProvider, EncryptedFileKeyProvider, and VaultKeyProvider
   - ✅ Added KeyManager facade for convenient access to keys
   - ✅ Created AuditLogger for comprehensive security audit logging
   - ✅ Developed SecureBlockchainService that integrates with key management
   - ✅ Added tests for all components to ensure security and reliability
   - ✅ Updated deployment scripts to use secure key storage
   - ✅ Added script for key management CLI operations

## Adjusted High Priority (React/TypeScript Focus)
1. **Enhance EIP-712 Implementation in React/TypeScript**
   - Improve the TypeScript implementation for better type safety
   - Create React hooks for EIP-712 signature creation and verification 
   - Develop a more user-friendly signature UI with clear security indicators
   - Add comprehensive TypeScript typings for all EIP-712 operations

2. **Blockchain Network Abstraction with React Context**
   - Create a React context for blockchain network configuration
   - Implement a network selector component for the UI
   - Support multiple networks through an abstracted provider pattern
   - Add network-specific configuration options in the UI settings

3. **Complete React Component Library for Fingerprinting**
   - Create a dedicated npm package for fingerprinting React components
   - Implement composable components for different fingerprinting operations
   - Add theming support for better integration with host applications
   - Create storybook documentation for component usage

## Medium Priority
4. **Improve Developer Experience**
   - Add comprehensive TypeScript typings for all components
   - Create better error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Improve loading states and progress indicators
   - Implement React hooks for common fingerprinting operations

5. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Redesign the fingerprint verification process for better user understanding
   - Add visualization components for fingerprint status and history
   - Implement dark mode and accessibility improvements
   - Create mobile-responsive versions of all components

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
   - Add client-side caching for verification results
   - Optimize blockchain interactions to reduce wait times
   - Create a background verification service for bulk operations

7. **Integration Examples for Popular Frameworks**
   - Add integration examples for Next.js
   - Create sample implementations for React Native
   - Provide documentation for integration with popular state management libraries
   - Build example projects showing fingerprinting in real-world applications

## Lower Priority
8. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement multi-signature support for organizations
   - Add batch operations for fingerprinting multiple agents
   - Create an admin dashboard for fingerprint management
   - Develop analytics components for monitoring fingerprint usage

9. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Create comprehensive TypeScript documentation
   - Add more code examples for common use cases
   - Improve README with clear getting started guide
   - Add sustainability section documenting environmental impact

10. **Testing Improvements**
    - Increase test coverage to ≥90%
    - Add end-to-end tests for main user flows
    - Implement visual regression testing for UI components
    - Create performance benchmarking tests

11. **Environmental Impact**
    - Add carbon footprint calculation for blockchain operations
    - Create UI components showing environmental impact
    - Implement preferences for eco-friendly blockchain options
    - Document best practices for minimizing environmental impact

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **Enhance EIP-712 Implementation in React/TypeScript** - Focus on improving the type safety and creating reusable React hooks for signature creation and verification.
2. **Create a Blockchain Network Context Provider** - Develop a React context to manage blockchain network configurations.

This revised plan focuses more heavily on React/TypeScript development and creating reusable components that can be integrated into various projects, which aligns better with your shift away from the Python-based A2A project.
